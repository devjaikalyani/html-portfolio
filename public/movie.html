<h1>The Best Movies according to Dev</h1>
<h2>my Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Interstellar isn't just a movie; it's an experience that sweeps you off your feet and launches you into the farthest reaches of the universe. Christopher Nolan weaves a mesmerizing tale that's equal parts heart-wrenching and awe-inspiring, leaving you
    spellbound from start to finish.

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Inception is not just a movie; it's a journey into the uncharted territories of the human mind. Directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, this film is a mind-bending masterpiece that captivates and challenges its audience in ways few movies ever dare.
    From its gripping storyline to its breathtaking visual effects and stellar performances, Inception is a cinematic experience that will linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll.</p>

<h3>Avengers End Game</h3>
<p>This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters
    all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.</p>
